\section{Marking sheme - remove before submission}

Reflecting on your practice is the hardest part of writing the dissertation, so you are encouraged to talk to the course coordinators and demonstrators to find out what you could include in this section. A good source of examples of incidents for reflection is often the documentation from your retrospectives, because you used the retrospectives to identify areas of your process that could be changed or done better. You should also, try to relate your experiences to other studies available in the software engineering literature (the recommended reading is a good starting point for this).

For example, if you found that you had to drop a feature during an iteration, discuss the reasons why the feature had to be dropped. Had you given yourselves too much work? Was the feature harder to implement than you realised? Had you got your priorities wrong? Then consider looking at the literature (see the recommended reading for PSD3) on project planning and estimation. Was your experience typical of a software project? What steps do other developers advocate for improving estimation?

Alternatively, did you have to make some big design decisions or choice of software platforms early on in the project? What impact did these choices have? Were they the right ones? How might you have improved the decision making process to reduce uncertainty? Did you implement a prototype before proceeding to far with the main implementation? How much effort did this involve? What did you learn about the platform as a result?

The dissertation should be a single PDF document of a maximum of 12 pages, not including front matter and references. You must use the LaTeX template provided for the dissertation and include all the requested meta-data. The LaTeX source for the template, your dissertation and any associated figures should be stored in your version control repository in a clearly indicated directory or branch. It must be possible to build the dissertation PDF from this source, using an automated build script, such as the ant build script provided.

\begin{itemize}
\item Presentation/structure -  	Is the dissertation complete, well organised, clear and literate? Are there examples of spelling mistakes or poor grammar in the dissertation? Is there a clear logical argument and structure to the narrative? Are references used effectively? Are the references complete?
\item Description of objectives and achievements. - Are the problem domain, scope and objectives of the project clear? Is it clear what was achieved during the project and what the key technical challenges were?
\item Reflection -  	Are there a number of experiences/critical events discussed in the dissertation? Does each experience answer the following questions: What was the circumstances of the event? What was learned as a result of the experience? What changed in the project team (if anything) as a result of the experience? Is the experience related to other case studies available in the software engineering literature?
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}



Software engineering 

This paper presents a case study of... 
%% An introduction, explaining the purpose of the document, a very brief outline of the project and a summary of the structure of the rest of the document (approximately 1 pages).

%% Final paragraph.
The rest of the case study is structured as follows.  Section
\ref{sec:background} presents the background of the case study
discussed, describing the customer and project context, aims and
objectives and project state at the time of writing.  Sections
\ref{sec:Issue1} through Section \ref{sec:Issue3} discuss issues that
arose during the project...

%==============================================================================
\section{Case Study Background}

Include details of 
%% A description of the case study background and context. This should include a description of the project customer (what was the nature of the organisation you were working for), their objectives for the project, and a summary of what was actually achieved. Where appropriate, this section should also make reference to similar related projects in order to make the context clear (approximately 1-3 pages).

\subsection{Our client}
%% The customer organisation and background.
\subsection{Our project}
%%  The rationale and initial objectives for the project.
\subsection{Our software}
%% The final software was delivered for the customer.

%==============================================================================
\section{Reflections}
\subsection{Windowbuilder themed part, not sure about name yet}

Incidents and events:
- Moving things about in the GUI disaasociated comments from corresponding code
- Made merge impossible
- Propagation of early, "temporary" design decisions
- Difficult to rename variables
- Look into why diff was so confused
- Mention abandoned branch merges
- Could only complete changes on the last day afer everyone else was done
- Perhaps something on deadlocks waiting for others to finish

What we learned:
- Make more files
- Balance workload
- Push earlier releases to see all the cracks in the seams
- Acknowledge that there is no such thing as temporary code.

%==============================================================================
\subsection{Testing or lack thereof}

Incidents and events
- Set up yaml / autotesting - it mostly failed due to forgetting to add supporitng files to repo. Medium useful, but mostly a dry run learning exercise
- Old software was kind of shit at working without the hardware and it was hard to see if the results were the same
- Very hard to make progress away from St Alwin building because you don't know if you're going in the right direction - therefore progress somewhat sporadic
- Even when things do work it's difficult to prove (like with the testing exercise)

What we learned:
- A hardware emulator would have helped, but would the effort of building one be worth it?
- Agree on more rigorous manual tests?
- Agree each person goes in each weekday and tests everyone's progress? Would have helped with familiarity of each other's code too.

%==============================================================================
\subsection{Issue3}

%% Several sections that reflect on your experiences during the team project. Each section should discuss one theme, characterised by incidents or events that occurred during the team course of the project from which you learned (approximately 8-10 pages).
%==============================================================================

\section{Conclusions}
%% A conclusion that draws general and wider lessons from the case study (approximately 1-2 pages).
Explain the wider lessons that you learned about software engineering,
based on the specific issues discussed in previous sections.  Reflect
on the extent to which these lessons could be generalised to other
types of software project.  Relate the wider lessons to others
reported in case studies in the software engineering literature.
